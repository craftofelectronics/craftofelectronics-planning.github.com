<h2>Welcome to (the) Craft of Electronics!</h2>
 <p>We're creating a world where it's possible for students to learn college-level electronics in a craft-first (and theory-sometime-later) format, through learning from, participating in, and contributing to the open hardware movement.
 </p>
 <p>Pragmatically, what this means is that we're embarking on the curation and remixing of material from hackerspaces and the open hardware movement and taking inspiration from recent curricular advances in electrical engineering in order to end up with a set of modular activities that can be linked into a series of college electronics classes. It will be tough, it will be deep, and it will show the world that "rigor" in electronics can mean far more than the use of abstract mathematics.
 </p>
 <p>And we're going to do it in the open from Day 0. Everything's going to be open hardware, open source, open content, and done the open source way. We'd love your help.
 </p>

<h2>Who are you people?</h2>
<p>We're <a href="http://jadud.com">Matt Jadud</a>, <a href="http://blog.melchua.com">Mel Chua</a>, and <a href="http://blog.sdziallas.com">Sebastian Dziallas</a>, and we'll be spending the summer of 2012 Making This Happen. We'd love your company; come say hi on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/craftofelectronics">mailing list</a>.

<h2>The Schedule of Tentativeness</h2>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure rollout <em>June 10-30, 2012</em></li>
<li>A roadtrip through makerspaces <em>July 2012, West-To-East scout ship</em></li>
<li>A tour of engineering colleges <em>July 2012, East-To-West scout ship</em></li>
<li>Curricular remixing and testing <em>July 2012, Mission Control</em></li>
<li>Wrap-up and write-up <em>Early August 2012</em></li>
<li>And then who knows? <em>infinity and beyond...</em></eli>
</ul>
<h2>Can I help?</h2>
<p>Yeah! We're in the early stages, so it's a glorious mess; hop right in on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/craftofelectronics">mailing list</a> and introduce yourself, and we'll get you started.
</p>
<h2>This isn't enough information!</h2>
<p>Working on it! Everything you see is literally everything we have; this website was created in a hurry after lunch on March 24, 2012. We'll make things public the moment we create them (but are trying to finish all our classes for the spring semester first). If you're impatient, try asking questions on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/craftofelectronics">mailing list</a> to help us get going.</p>
