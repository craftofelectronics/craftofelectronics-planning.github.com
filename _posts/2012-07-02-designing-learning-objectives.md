Learning objectives have been the next big thing on the agenda. Since the theory of the craft of electronics consists of three major items, **design**, **safety**, and **fabrication**, it made sense to focus brainstorming on these three categories. In particular in the area of fabrication, this lead to a number of project ideas that we'll test over the course of the next weeks. But how does design fit into this space?

## Different Levels of Design

The term *design* can be applied in a lot of ways: there's circuit & breadboard design (including best practices like avoiding crossed wires) on the one side, and a full-blown user-oriented design approach that takes the needs of a target audience into account on the other. Now this is an introduction to electronics, not a user-centered collaborative design course. That said, talking through the steps of user-centered design let us identify the most important parts of it to come up with a simplified model that we could apply to this course as well.

First and foremost, it's about the people: a target group (the users) and their particular needs. At a very simple level, the design process then consists of continuous iteration between constructing a prototype and testing it against the needs of a user. Once the certain confidence in both the needs and the prototype has been achieved, we can trigger a first (more permanent) release or build.

One of the interesting aspects here is that the user group can vary. What if it is the college student working on the design? Well, the questions "what do I need?" and "does this prototype design make sense?" still apply. In fact, they allow for something we've dubbed as quantifiable self: personal behavior measurement and analysis (think tracking of sleep patters, for example). This is to say, we can use this framework not only to explain a simplified design process, but also to determine possible activities. Which, coincidentally, is what we'll be doing over the next couple of days.
