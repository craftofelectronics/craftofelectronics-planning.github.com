The Craft of Electronics is a project to develop an introductory electronics curriculum at Berea College in Kentucky. But it's also about *"creating a world where it's possible for students to learn college-level electronics in a craft-first (and theory-sometime-later) format, through learning from, participating in, and contributing to the open hardware movement."* In fact, we've been blogging, brainstorming, and writing on [craftofelectronics.org][main] where all of the content is available under a Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 license.

Well, you may say, why the shout-out now? If you've been following us on [Twitter][twitter], you'll notice that our current logo isn't even very deserving of that name. So.

<img src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-05-25/pqrhqxgjxDhrippktFwlDbuGjExAgdfleEiFGCkuBocuBueysBhGHGuHfybm/help-1.png.scaled500.png">

Help us out with a new logo! We promise we won't be picky, but it needs to meet a few of specifications:

* it needs to come as a vector graphic
* it needs to perform well as a Twitter/identi.ca icon, as well as on t-shirts or when engraved in wood; this is obviously a somewhat subjective statement, but we'd love to talk to you.
* it needs to be licensed at least under a CC-BY-SA 3.0 license (more permissive licenses are of course also acceptable & welcome)

And here's what's in for you: we said "engraved in wood" above. That's right, at Berea, we have access to a machine shop including a laser cutter. So if we chose your design, you'll receive:

* the gratitude of the entire team ([@jadudm](https://twitter.com/jadudm), [@mchua](https://twitter.com/mchua), [@sdziallas](https://twitter.com/sdziallas))
* a t-shirt with the logo on it -- we'll be making these for us and get you one as well
* a wooden plate with the logo engraved for you to put on your desk (or your mug on, if you're so inclined)

If you're up for the challenge, you can email us on the [mailing list][list].
