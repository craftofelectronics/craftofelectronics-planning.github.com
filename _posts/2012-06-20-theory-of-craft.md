# Lots of Concept Maps

## Initial Questions

*What are the learning objectives for a craft-first course in a given context?*

This may be the question we've been trying to answer over the past couple of days. Hence, we looked at existing projects at the intersection of computing, craft, and electronics. A list of projects is available [here][etherpad]. The skills necessary to successfully complete these projects lead us towards identifying learning objectives.

## Bloom is Everywhere

![Concept Map][conceptmap]

We used [Bloom's Taxonomy][bloom] to rank the learning outcomes within thematical groupings. The concept map above represents a first rough draft. In particular, the major topics we discovered were **design**, **safety**, and **fabrication**. They were arranged in a triangle and had connections between each other. The picture below represents a synthesis of these learning goals.

## The Hardest Part

Having switched materials to a larger piece of paper, we worked to iron the representation out a little more. Although the major topics we had discussed remained the same, some of the items bridging them didn't sit entirely right. And so while it was clear that the process of **debugging** (through iterating, potentially between different representations of a circuit) connected design and fabrication, the question remained:

*How do you connect design & safety and fabrication & safety?*

Coming up and agreeing upon terms that could sit between these pairs was difficult. A deep understanding of the **theory** allows for the student to make safe design choices. But what about fabrication and safety? Ideating lead to a variety of terms, from human centered design over craft itself to workmanship, best practices, techniques and eventually **thinking with hands**. The latter represents the closest we got to describing a way of operating that can be intuitively acquired and applied by a student, without being overloaded with theory.

## A Theory of Craft-Based Electronics

![Theory][theory]

The mapping above represents our initial approach to a theory of craft-based electronics. We decided against explicitely using the term **craft** in the map, since we were trying to define the term itself while approaching the learning outcomes for our course.
