## Learning Objectives

We design learning experiences for students so they will take something away with them. No matter how amazing your course design, how impressive your technology, or expensive your classroom furniture, there always remains one, simple question:

*Did your students learn what you wanted them to learn?*

You can test your students any way you want, but for the assessment to mean anything, we need to know what the objective of the student's learning efforts was in the first place. Hence, we like to **define learning objectives** before we begin inventing assignments or superfluous examinations.

There are many ways to teach children to ride bicycles. One could, for example, create a series of videos and exercises on the Kahn Academy website. These would describe how one mounts, rides, and dismounts from a bicycle in some detail. Video examples could be provided for each step, and after each video, an examination. Students could then repeat the exam until they get a perfect score, go out into the streets of Bangalore, immediately fall off their bicycle, and promptly be run over by a Tata. (They'd be fine... Tata makes some small cars.)
