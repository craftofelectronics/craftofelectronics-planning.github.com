## Learning Objectives

We design learning experiences for students so they will take something away with them. No matter how amazing your course design, how impressive your technology, or expensive your classroom furniture, there always remains one, simple question:

*Did your students learn what you wanted them to learn?*

You can test your students any way you want, but for the assessment to mean anything, we need to know what the objective of the student's learning efforts was in the first place. Hence, we like to **define learning objectives** before we begin inventing assignments or superfluous examinations.

There are many ways to teach children to ride bicycles. One could, for example, create a series of videos and exercises that students might view and then answer. These would describe how one mounts, rides, and dismounts from a bicycle in some detail. Students could then repeat the videos and exercises until they get a perfect score, go out into the streets of Bangalore, and promptly fall off their bicycle be run over by a Tata. (They'd be fine... Tata makes some small cars.)

The learning objective in the above example may have been for the student to **learn to ride a bike**. The **instruction inappropriate given the objective**. The assessment was also inappropriate: it was too much like a final professional examination, as opposed to a first practical in a laboratory course.

## Electricity, Electronics, and Equations

Part of our conversation surrounding the teaching of electricity and electronics has to do with understanding how and why electronics is taught the way it is. By this, I mean "Why do so many people lecture about equations?" Most conversations about this topic focus on the lecture; for a moment, I'm curious why we're so concerned about *equations*.

I looked back at my lab notebook from my undergraduate course in Electronics, taken as a physics major. The notebook was a series of laboratories that explored gates, op amps, and other components in a completely context-free manner. Each laboratory exemplified some equation or theory, and I would collect data, plot a line, and demonstrate that the theory held out for the components in question. **So what?**

We've also been discussing electronics in the context of engineering curricula. The purpose there seems to be to prepare students to make millions of devices that are assembled by robots. Essentially, an EE is being prepared to engage in designing electronic devices for mass manufacture. If you're looking to only take one class on the subject of electricity and electronics, the student might be inclined to say: **so what?**

## Safe, Experienced Transitivity

Our three long-term learning outcomes for the course can be summarized as follows:

* Students should be able to **safely** approach electrical systems, whether it is a house or a circuit board.
* Students should know that their **experience**, more than documentation on a device or on paper, is what matters (and will keep them **safe**).
* Students should be able to read documentation, diagrams, and look at a physical system and see the **transitive** relationship between the three... but knowing **experience** will keep them **safe** where discrepancies exist.

I never took these lessons away from my own experience in electronics, and most EE students don't know how to wire a 3-way switch, either. But in a liberal arts context with a long tradition in the crafts of Appalachia, I want a course that is practical for **real people**, and that might serve as a stepping stone into further studies in computer science and electronics. 

## Towards Learning Objectives

As we begin thinking about learning objectives for the course, we've come to realize that we're prepared to throw away a great deal of conventional thinking about the topic of electronics. Our students are, quite simply, most likely to encounter electronics in one of three places:

1. Their house will need some basic electrical work --- rewiring a lamp or switch --- that they could easily do themselves.
1. They will want to do something interesting --- for themselves or someone else --- with low-cost digital electronic devices like the Arduino.
1. Some electronic component of a thing they own (a switch or sensor in a car, for example) might fail, and they would like to investigate that failure.

As we watch the rise of the "hobbyist engineer," or **maker**, it becomes clear that you do not need a college degree in electrical engineering to put together extremely interesting (and, in some cases, utilitarian) systems using low-cost electronics like the Arduino. Students who go down this path (and want to understand more) will not just have intrinsic motivation to pursue further study, but **explicit motivation** to understand Kirchoff's laws as they pertain to resistors in series (or parallel), or Ohm's law, or whatever else might be between them and their next creation.

Our learning objectives are what will dictate the kinds of learning activities we design for our students, the kinds of work we ask them to do in preparation of those activities, and what kinds of assessments we use to see if they have achieved those objectives. We aren't there yet, but our conversations are (while, in some circles, heretical), will get us there.
