As an undergraduate studying physics, I took a first course in electronics. We studied NAND gates, RC circuits, and a host of other things. I know this, because I recently found my lab book. Each laboratory involved building a small circuit, and then using an oscilloscope or other tool to take measurements. We would plot those measurements, compare our results to theory, and be done. 

That experience is now dead to me... I have no practical memories of what I studied. The only enduring lesson I have from the course is that, in electronics, pi (when doubled) might be approximated to either 5 or 10. I cannot, however, provide you with any heuristics that help me understand when it should be approximated to 5, or when it should be approximated to 10. (I suspect you choose by which makes the equation simplify best.)

# Enduring Understandings

It is important, as an educator, to remember that **what you say does not matter**. This is a difficult blow to the ego, but it is a good starting point: nothing we say matters. However, **everything our students do matters**. This mantra breaks down if you talk too much and give your students pointless, context-free busywork. 

Working from this (extreme, contestable) point-of-view, we can ask the question:

<p align="center">
  <em>What do we want our students to remember in 5 years</em>
</p>

We came up with three:

</p>

Spelled out:

1. Graduates must always **respect** electricity, and be able to work with electrical and electronic systems **safely**.
1. Graduates should develop practical skills in **building** electrical and electronic systems.
1. Graduates should have a **process for designing** systems involving electricity and electronics.

If I only get one:

  CRAFToE graduates must always respect, and be safe when working with, electrical and electronic systems.

# Enduring Transitions

It is not uncommon for educators to have too many learning objectives for a single course. We are in danger of this with our framework of enduring understandings... but, that said, we intend to use these to frame our objectives and the design of every laboratory and assignment in the course. We should be able to ask questions like:

* "Does this laboratory reinforce safe practice in electronics?" 
* "Does this discussion encourage students to engage in a design process?"
* "Does this practical allow students to practice building and fabrication skills?"

If the answer is ever "no," then we have to ask whether the activity is flawed or, worse, whether the learning objective is flawed. (We'll be writing up learning objectives shortly.) The "enduring understandings" serve as guiding principles for the rest of our course design---they need to be reinforced in everything we do, so that our students will (at the least) always approach electrical systems safely and with respect.

That said, we realized that the connections (what I will call our *enduring transitions*) are important as well.

Spelled out:

* We build things safely by **thinking with our hands**. A clean workspace tools in good repair lead to safety for yourself and the piece you are working on.
* We turn designs into reality by understanding the **equivalence** of a schematic, PCB, and the associated documentation. Once built, we debug our creations **iteratively** by moving back-and-forth between the design and piece we have fabricated.
* We design safely by understanding **theory**; we validate the safety of our designs through **testing**. Neither is a substitute for the other.

The transitions are important because they help us, as educators (and students) understand how the enduring understandings are connected. You cannot fabricate safely in a shop that is a mess: tools must be organized and stowed away from the work area and walkways, regardless of whether it is an ISO-rated plant or someone's garage. Likewise, nothing we build is perfect the first time through---the process of questioning everything about the build, going back to the schematic, and learning to "read" back-and-forth between object and document is critical.

# Framing Experience

The **master maker** ("craftsman" is a bit gendered) moves around this circle continuously: they have all their fingers, they iterate and perfect their designs, and understand the theory that makes their craft possible. This depth of understanding and ability, gained through a lifetime of practice, is called **experience**. 

While we do not expect our students to become master makers in a single semester, we want their first experience in electronics to put them on that path. This framing does not, to us, imply a semester spent memorizing equations and measuring circuits "out of context," like I did as an undergraduate physics major. Instead, we see our students **empowered** to engage in **collaborative** processes where they **iteratively** build, test, learn about, and evaluate electronic and electrical systems that are **immediately relevant** to them.
