Over the past couple of days, we've been working on the course calendar. In this post, I'll outline some of the ideas we've had. The slideshow below contains our mapping of the course; each post-it note represents an activity and is marked with an estimated duration.

* **Week 0:** (this week isn't in the slideshow yet, we've punted and dubbed it "magic" -- we'd like students to experience the craft of electronics right from the first session on)
* **Week 1:** We'll start with some basic activities, like wire stripping, and various kinds of soldering. Students will begin capturing their process and product and finally assemble their own Arduino.
* **Week 2:** We'll introduce students to the laser cutter and have a few basic labs that use resistors, LEDs, motors, etc. There'll also be a part that focuses on using video to document work.
* **Week 3:** Here, we continue to explore data collection, this time using the OpenLog. Students will also assemble a power supply, likely a MintyBoost. The idea here is that they'll be able to use these pieces to create a box that they can carry with themselves over the weekend and capture a parameter of their surroundings -- in this case, light over a period of time.
* **Week 4:** Through analyzing and discussing the previously collected data, we'll cover the accuracy of internal and real time clocks. Students will use explore the oscilloscope and report the results of their work here.
* **Week 5:** In this week, we included a slack day, since things will likely shift around. This is the first time this course is being offered, after all. Other than that, assorted reports will be due and students will reassemble their data collection box, this time with the added benefit of a real time clock. Data collection will ensue again over the weekend.
* **Week 6:** We'll compare and present the two data sets at this beginning of this week. Students will also work towards creating an energy tracker, since we'll have introduced all necessary components at this point. Reports can take place in video form.
* **Week 7:** Over the weekend, students will collect data again. However, at this point, there'll be a midterm asking students to identify the contents of a box similar to the one they created simply by observing and analyzing the data produced.

### What Next?

Well, you may have seen us tweet about miniature houses, and we've been talking about using those to have students look into the complexity of wiring. So we'll do just that. While they are laser-cutting their own miniature houses, they'll be introduced to safely wiring components, for example on large proto boards. With the assembled houses, we'll kick off a home automation project that will require brainstorming, and creativity, but also the design of circuits and their respective diagrams, as well as the actual implementation. Watch out for further posts!
