We've been talking a lot about learning objectives lately. Well, here's a first draft that roughly follows three major objectives in the categories below. Again, this is only a first stab at formulating them and they aren't quite *there* yet, so we'd love to hear your thoughts. Send them off to the [mailing list][list] or tweet us [@craftoe][twitter].

## Observation & Analysis

- **synthesis:** draw out or execute a plan to scale a successful one-person quantified self project to multiple people; list and explain the new things that are enabled by the change in scale. *(Note: this is a poorly written LO, suggestions welcome!)*

## Fabrication & Debugging
- **synthesis:** sketch out at least 3 different prototypes to address needs of users, identify critical components in a block diagram, and articulate differences between the proposed designs.
- **analysis:** assemble and test the proposed design system, as well as individual components of it; provide at least 3 suggestions for improvement based on performance in test or describe adequacy of system.
- **synthesis:** use a circuit diagram to correctly place a component on a PCB - find the part, find board location, solder it.
comprehension: exhibit safe professional behavior, e.g. by maintaining a clean workspace, cutting & stripping wires cleanly with appropriate lengths, and arranging them neatly on a breadboard, making neat and firm connections, respecting equipment
- **evaluation:** evaluate quality of tools; e.g. identify sources of error in circuits and propose strategies to eliminate potential error, compensate for wrong traces, and fix issues with breadboards.
- **knowledge:** identify of components on a breadboard accurately
- **application:** soldering, desoldering, through hole components, reflow - patience, tinning tip, fine-pitch smt
- **application:** insert and extract a variety of components safely from a breadboard and PCB
- **application:** *(Note: something home electricity related - "heading and connections" might go here, or "90 degree turns" -- I know nothing about house wiring so I don't know what goes in here; again, suggestions welcome!)*

## Design Process

### Communication

- **comprehension:** create a short (25-250 words and/or one image) description of the project communicating its purpose to potential users or third parties. A good description will introduce the project's goals to people encountering the project for the first time, and set expectations for participation of both users and contributors.
- **comprehension:** describe a specific activity you've engaged in in terms of recorded words, images & pictures - the process of how the idea evolved over time, and the factors that contributed to its development are written or spoken in clear, well-ordered paragraphs of grammatical English. All facts are accurate and checked, with citations and links to artifacts included when appropriate. Readers should be able to follow your process along in time well enough to envision it for themselves. You should be able to describe a brainstorming activity as well as a user interaction activity.
- **evaluation:** document and publish the story of your project (video / visual / text) with sufficient detail for someone else to replicate your work, including a self-assessment of how well you performed and what they would do differently next time.

### Iterated Process

- **application:** demonstrate iterated brainstorming through documented design wall usage (post-its & clustering) - a good brainstorm will tend to produce at least 25 ideas, with at least 3 of these ideas demonstrating non-obvious, zany, etc. solutions. *(Note: we're not satisfied with these criteria, and recognize that they are rules of thumb; how to give students guidelines on what a "good" iterated brainstorm's deliverables look like is an open question that we need help with!)*
- **synthesis:** revisit ideation in light of user interaction data within 48 hours of a user interaction and produce a brainstorm iteration (as explained above) based on the information acquired during that user visit.
- **evaluation:** evaluate the functionality of prototype or design against list of user needs using the data from user interaction. Based on this evaluation, produce a list of at least 3 next actions & improvements or justify why user needs are adequately addressed.

### Interaction with Users

- **evaluation:** engage in an observation of users in their usual context. This includes fulfilling all the items on the following checklist: show up early for the observation, bring your tools (notebook/recording device, prepared mind, etc) prepared and ready to go, find an appropriate location for your observation (unobtrusive), being quiet and respectful of their work (don't interrupt it; take notes -- we may want more detail on what "good" notes look like, and can get these from how-to guides for teaching student ethnographers), asking appropriate questions (open-ended, considerate, and well-timed), staying for the entire duration of the observation session, and thanking your partipant at the end.
- **analysis:** demonstrate a deep understanding of user's needs given the context observed. *(Note: we're not sure how to flesh this in but we'll see if others can provide input on definitions of "deep" and ways of measuring it)*
